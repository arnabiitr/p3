# Project 3
+ By: Arnab Bhar
+ Production URL: <http://p3.dwa-fall2018-arnab.me/>

## Outside resources
I have just used some bootstrap classes to lightly style some of the text areas
https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/js/bootstrap.min.js

## 3 Unique inputs
This program finds the number of counts of the email in the content entered in the text area and validates and appends the website url with the count # found in the above step: (1) Text input for email , (2) Text input for Website Url  (3) Text Area for Content (4) There is a check box which adds the amount 2 if checked to matches found

## Packages
* barryvdh/laravel-debugbar
* barryvdh/laravel-ide-helper

## Code style divergences
none

## Notes for instructor
I used Server validations on the input elements
