## Outside resources
*I have just used some bootstrap classes to lightly style some of the text areas*

## 3 Unique inputs
*This program finds the number of counts of the email in the content entered in the text area and validates and appends the website url with the count # found in the above step: (1) Text input for email , (2) Text input for Website Url  (3) Text Area for Content *

## Code style divergences

## Notes for instructor
I used Server validations on the input elements
